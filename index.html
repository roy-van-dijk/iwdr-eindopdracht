				<p>
					Brooklyn Nine-Nine is an American police television sitcom that premiered on Fox on September 17, 2013. 
					Created by Dan Goor and Michael Schur, the series revolves around Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg), 
					an immature but talented NYPD detective in Brooklyn's 99th Precinct, who comes into immediate conflict with his new commanding officer, 
					the serious and stern Captain Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher). The ensemble and supporting cast feature Stephanie Beatriz as Rosa Diaz, 
					Terry Crews as Terrence "Terry" Jeffords, Melissa Fumero as Amy Santiago, Joe Lo Truglio as Charles Boyle, Chelsea Peretti as Regina "Gina" Linetti, 
					Dirk Blocker as Michael Hitchcock and Joel McKinnon Miller as Norman "Norm" Scully.
				</p>

				<p>
					Produced in Los Angeles as a single-camera comedy, Fox originally ordered thirteen episodes for its first season, 
					eventually expanding it to 22 episodes. Since its debut, the series has received critical acclaim, with the cast, 
					especially Samberg and Braugher, being singled out for praise. It has won two Creative Arts Emmy Awards, 
					and two Golden Globe Awards: one for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and one for Andy Samberg for Best Actor – 
					Television Series Musical or Comedy. Andre Braugher has also been nominated for three consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards.

				<h3>Synopsis</h3>

				<p>
					Set in the fictional 99th Precinct of the New York City Police Department in Brooklyn, 
					Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows a team of detectives headed by newly appointed Captain Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher). 
					Among the detectives is Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg), who frequently tops the squad in collars despite his relaxed, 
					carefree attitude, much to the annoyance of his more by-the-book colleague, Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). 
					Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) is a reliable but quirky detective whose emotions can sometimes go wild, 
					as opposed to the stoic and mysterious Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz). The final two detectives, 
					Michael Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker) and Norman "Norm" Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller), are older and often incompetent, 
					although not without their usefulness. The detectives report to Sergeant Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), 
					a devoted family man who is initially afraid to go back to active police work for fear that he might die in the line of duty and 
					thus leave his children without a father. Rounding out the precinct is sarcastic civilian administrator Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti), 
					who seems to value everything like dancing and her social life over work, and does anything to avoid her job.
